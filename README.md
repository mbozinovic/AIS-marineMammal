# AIS-marineMammal
Literature search on research using AIS data to examine the relationship between ships and marine mammal populations/behavior, 
with emphasis on analytical techniques and data visualizations that may be applicable to SWFSC SAEL data. 
Here, I highlight the diversity of studies within AIS/marine mammal research and show notable visualizations.

Here you'll find a Zotero library file and PDFs of a report and presentation.
